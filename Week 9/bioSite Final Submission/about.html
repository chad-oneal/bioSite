                    line production time and improvements. Prior to becoming an Engineer Matthew was a student
                    at Middle Tennessee State University (MTSU). While attending MTSU, Matthew was and still is a very
                    involved family man and a man with a passion for his hobbies. He married his wife Deanna in the spring

                    be a better person than he was the day before; his accomplishments shine in both his professional and
                    personal life. Being an excellent father is paramount in his personal life. He believes that even though
                    we live in an unfair world, that it is important to teach his children to deal with this world with
                    emotional intelligence and above all Love. Matthew is also quite an artist which serves him both
                    professionally and personally. He has stated that even if not paid for it he would explore the world of
                    Art, using multimedia to create something weird and other worldly. He enjoys letting his ever expansive
                    and creative mind wonder what could be added into our universe without consequence. Lets click the
